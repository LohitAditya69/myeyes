When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever
To watch our life (to watch our life together)
You just like going to Heaven (my heart)
Oh, your vanity
I'm fallin', and I'm drownin'
But you're takin' meeee

One thousand on my feet
Stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes

Rollie Pollie on my wrist
Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' on FaceTime
Fifty K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldened by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Late from the country cadence
No peacemaker, I sweep up cases
Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a hammer
Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beefin' up, fuck a beef
Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer (huh)
I need no beef, no cheese (yeah)
Even when I eat, they cheat (uh)
Every time we meet, na√Øve

When I stare in your eyes
Still be there forever
To watch our life (to watch out life together)
You just like going to Heav- (my heart)

One thousand on my feet
Stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (eyes)

Yeah, it's mad how it gets so deep
It's mad how I gets so hot
It's mad how you get me by (by)

It's me, it's me, it's me, it's-

Look in my eyes, tell me a tale
Do you see the road, a map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect, or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin', and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights
And right by my side all I see is a sea of people that ride with me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted
I gotta find balance and keep me inspired
Yeah, yeah
That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
I run it from miles, this shit wasn't luck
They got me fucked up, I put you on bust and take you around
A couple of guys inside of that school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
They say they the ones when they make the errors
Can't look in the mirror, that shit wild
I stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
We do it in streets, we do it for keeps
We do it for rights, got fifty-two weeks
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me beat and I turn into a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink
